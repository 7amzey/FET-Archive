# FET Archive

FET Archive or Facility of Engineering and Technology Archive is a web application made to help students in electrical department at BAU/FET find the best resources in one place in addition to other services to help students with their studies in this project I used multiple technologies as in frontend I have used HTML, CSS[Bootstrap], and Vanilla JS and for the backend I have used Django framework built on top of python and for the database I'm using sqlite3 as it comes out of the box with Django projects.
